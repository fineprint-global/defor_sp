# Prepare land use change data --------------------------------------------

# Read in TIF raster files from "data/landsat", merge them with the SHP map 
# of political boundaries found in "data/municipios" and create a tidy tibble.
# Intermediate and final outputs are stored in "data/geo".

# Read in TIFs and merge them with the SHP file using `raster::extract`. Creates
# a list of extracted dataframes and stores it as "geo_extract_raw.rds".
# Very computationally intensive, done via `parallel::parLapply` if available.

# Stores said tibble as "geo_extract.rds".
